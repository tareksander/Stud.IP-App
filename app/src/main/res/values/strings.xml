<h2 id="1" >1. Login</h2>
First you should choose you authentication method from the settings.<br>
If you only want to log in once, you should use HTTP Basic authentication.<br>
If you don't want you username and password stored on the device (don't worry they're encrypted), you should choose the session cookie.<br>
If you use the session cookie, notifications will only work as long as the cookie is valid.<br>
When the session is over, you have to log in again to get notifications.<br>
If you don't want to give your username and password to this app, you can use OAuth.<br>
For OAuth you will be redirected to you Stud.IP in your browser app and have to log in there, to authorize access for the app.<br>
OAuth only works for Stud.IP systems that have this app registered.<br>
If your Stud.IP system isn't registered, you are offered the option to open you mailing app with a template text to send to you administrator, 
so they can enable OAuth for this app for your Stud.IP.<br>
If all goes well after that, the next app update will bring OAuth support for the Stud.IP system.<br>
The downside to OAuth is that some features in the app require a valid Stud.IP session, which the app doesn't get with OAuth.<br>
The unavailable features are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Searching for addressees when writing a message.<br>
You can only write messages to people who wrote messages to you or people whe you have seen in the course members screen in the app.<br></li>
<li>Posting in the forum. The API has a bug that prevents posting in the forum with the API, so the app 
uses the way a browser would post, but that requires a session.<br></li>
<li>Getting notifications. Similarly to the forum posting, there is no API to get notification.<br></li>
<li>Changing the Stud.IP notification settings in the app. Again, like the forum posting, there is no API.<br></li>
<li>The courseware, opencast and meetings plugins.<br></li>
</ul><br>
If you want more information about the authentication methods, long press on them in the settings screen.<br><br><br>
To log in you have to select you Stud.IP server.<br>
You can look for it in the list (scrolling is possible), or type it in yourself (without https://).<br>
Then you have to enter your username and password (if you don't use OAuth).<br>
<br><br>


<h2 id="2" >2. General & Settings</h2>
All dialogs and screens use swipe-to-refresh to get new data from the server.<br>
Apart from the files all data is cached on the device and can be viewed without an internet connection.<br>
The files have to be downloaded manually on demand.<br>
You have 2 ways of reaching normal screens:<br>
<ul>
<li>swiping left and right to go to the adjacent screen.<br></li>
<li>use the tab icon at the top to jump to the specific screen.<br></li>
</ul><br>
On smaller devices, you may have to scroll the tabs to the left or right, because the tab icons may not all fit on the screen.<br>
2 screen can only be reached via the tab icon: The settings screen and the mobile view screen.<br>
The notification service can send you notifications if the data changes.<br>
You can set the update frequency and notification priority in the settings.<br>
The notification service only shows notifications you enabled in the Stud.IP notification settings.<br>
These settings can be changed in-app under "Stud.IP notification settings".<br>
With the document provider you can use your Stud.IP files like all other files on your device.<br>
After you logged in, you can use the settings screen to select the courses you wish to expose via the document provider.<br>
You can also set whether to show image previews when using mobile data.<br>
You can set this app as you default browser app, to automatically open Stud.IP links in the app.<br>
But this app isn't a full browser, so links that don't point to Stud.IP have to be relayed to a real browser app.<br>
In the settings you can set which browser app to use.<br>
If you don't set a browser app, you will be asked to choose one for every link.<br><br>

<h2 id="3" >3. Deactivated features</h2>
Your Stud.IP administrators may not have enabled the whole API.<br>
The App doesn't use the whole API, so that may not be a problem.<br>
But if the app detects at login that parts of the API are deactivated that the app actually uses, you will see a dialog reporting all missing features.<br>
If some core API is disabled, logging in will not work at all.<br>
You can ask your administrators to enable the API.<br>
All API routes the app uses are listed in the <a href="https://github.com/tareksander/Stud.IP-App">Github Readme</a>.<br>
In the settings screen, you also have the option to re-scan for missing features.<br>
Use this if your administrators have enabled parts of the API and you don't want to log in again.<br>
You can also tell the App to ignore missing features.<br>
All features use multiple API routes, so if only some of them are disabled, a feature might work partially, but don't rely on it working.<br>
If you want to use a feature for which the API is disabled, you can also use the mobile view screen.<br>
<br><br>


<h2 id="4" >4. Home</h2>
On this screen you can see your Stud.IP name and the global Stud.IP news.<br>
You can open another window for the app by clicking the button at the top.<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="5" >5. Courses</h2>
On this screen you can view your courses for a specific semester.<br>
The icons for the courses work like on the website, but some features aren't implemented yet.<br>
You can use the flag icon to view course news.<br>
With the file icon you can view the files of a specific course.<br>
With the person icon you can open the course member screen.<br>
If you click on a member in that screen the user dialog is opened.<br><br>



<h2 id="6" >6. Files</h2>
On this screen you can view your files and course files.<br>
Tap \"…\" to return to the parent directory, hold to return to you own files.<br>
Tap on a folder to view its contents, tap on a file to download it.<br>
Long press on a file or folder to delete it.<br><br>

<h2 id="7" >7. Messages</h2>
On this screen you can view and write Stud.IP messages.<br>
With the two tabs at the top you can switch between you send and received messages.<br>
Long press on a message to delete it.<br>
To choose the addressee the app searches for known users with a name like the one you wrote.<br>
When you press the "Search" button, the app searches for new users with the specified name in the Stud.IP system.<br>
Add the addressee by tapping it in the list.<br>
Long press on an addressee to remove it.<br>
With the "Full sync"-button you can synchronize the messages between the server and the device.<br>
That can be useful if the swipe-to-refresh doesn't recognize a new message.<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="8" >8. Courseware plugin</h2>
By clicking the courseware icon for a course in the courses screen you can view the Courseware, if there is any.<br>
Tap in a chapter on the left to load the subchapters, tap on a subchapter to load the sections.<br>
Supported blocks are:<br>
<ul>
<li>HTML<br></li>
<li>Opencast<br></li>
<li>PDF<br></li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<h2 id="9" >9. Meetings plugin</h2>
Tapping the meetings icon for a course loads all meeting rooms available.<br>
When you click a button, a new window will open with the BigBlueButton conference.<br>
When navigating away, the window automatically goes into picture-in-picture mode and the presentation is set to fullscreen, so the conference can continue without interruption.<br>
As long as the conference is active, there is a non-dismissible notification present.<br>
The notification has actions to exit the conference and to toggle the microphone.<br>
Tapping the notification returns to the conference in full-screen.<br>
The PiP-window also has a button to toggle the microphone.<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="10" >10. Mobile view screen</h2>
You can open the mobile browser version of Stud.IP by clicking the globe tab icon.<br>
If you use HTTP Basic authentication, the login form will be filled out for you.<br>
If you use cookie authentication, the cookie will be shared with the mobile screen and you don't have to log in as long as you session cookie is valid.<br>
With OAuth the app doesn't get a session cookie, so you have to log in manually.<br>
If you click a link that would navigate away from Stud.IP, the link will be opened in you browser app.<br>
If you download files in the mobile view, the filename will be the download URL, because the app can't determine the filename.<br>
Like with all screens, you can swipe down to refresh the page.<br>
If you logout, the app instead returns you to the previous screen.<br>
The back button navigates back in the web page history, or returns to the previous screen if there is no history left.<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="11" >11. Shortcuts</h2>
By long pressing the tab icon you can create a shortcut to a specific screen.<br>
You can use this to e.g. open the app directly in the messages screen.<br>
You can also create launcher shortcuts for other things:<br>
You can create a shortcut to a folder by holding the "Your files" or the course name in the files screen.<br>
You can create a shortcut to a forum entry by holding the title on the entry list.<br>
You can create a shortcut to a courseware section by holding the corresponding "i"-icon.V
You can create a shortcut to a site in the mobile view by:<br>
Scrolling to the bottom and tapping the lens icon on the lower right (Android 6.0+).<br>
Pulling down the notification drawer, hiding it again and clicking the lens icon (Android 5.1-).<br>
