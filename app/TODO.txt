    TODO for android 12:
        [ ] https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/web-intent-resolution#request-user-associate-app-with-domain
           upon login, request for the user to associate the app with the host used to log in
        [ ] for the meetings activity, set the PiP-Params to setSeamlessResizeEnabled(true);
        [ ] opt-out of stretching for overscroll?
        [ ] https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/splash-screen
            customize the splash screen?

    Roadmap:
        1.0.0:
            [x] add another way to generate the tab shortcuts, because the static shortcuts take space for the dynamic ones
                [x] long press on the tab icon
            [x] put the badge on the github readme: https://play.google.com/intl/en_gb/badges/
            [x] add a table of contents to the help screen, with hyperlinks. probably requires using a WebView do use the hyperlinks
            [x] app integration
                [x] https://developer.android.com/training/sharing/receive
                    https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-direct-share
                    Apparently, there is a bug in the android 10 emulator which prevents sharing shortcuts from working
                    Test on-device instead.
                    [x] add the last people the user send messages to as persons
            [ ] fix the cache miss problem when logging in in the webview and using the back button, probably by excluding it from the history
            [x] a way to open multiple tasks for the app, e.g. to view multiple coursewares
            [x] option to upload multiple files at once (finish the refreshing after that)
            [x] send a notification_read request when the user taps on a notification
            [x] set a message to read when the user opens it
            [x] color unread messages with red in the list
            [x] option to set the app as the default browser app and set a real browser app.
                All links to Stud.IP will get opened in the app, all other links are relayed to the chosen browser app.
                Only possible way for android < S, because you need ownership of a domain to use app links.
                On android S, you can ask the user to set the app as a standard app for link types.
                    [x] test the browser app querying on android 11
            [x] support for viewing Images in Forum Posts: Probably with another ImageHandler for Html.fromHtml
            [ ] deep links improvements
                [ ] support for more link types
                    [x] courseware
                    [x] opencast
                    [x] meetings
                    [x] forum
                    [ ] planner
                [x] for messages, load the message if it isn't already, and view it
                [ ] link to the course info and member screens
                [ ] link to the planner
                [x] open unknown link patterns in the WebView for the server
            [ ] delete data which is not in a server response, but still in the database
            [ ] add the option to search for new news and forum entries when refreshing courses and color the icon red, to get the same feature as
                the web version
                [ ] add the option for the notification service to do this and emit extra notifications, even if the notification setting is turned off
            [ ] better updating of messages, so not every message is downloaded on update, only the ones until a saved one is found
                [ ] don't care about deleting messages deleted from the server, the user can just also delete them locally
                [ ] when a message is deleted, don't sync with the server, just send a delete and delete it from the database
            [x] add the course info dialog
            [ ] add the course members dialog
            [ ] add the user info dialog
            [ ] support for the planner
            [ ] app widgets
                [ ] planner
                    [ ] updates automatically when the planner is updated in the app
                [ ] messages
                    [ ] button to check for new messages
                    [ ] clicking a message opens it in the app
                [ ] files
                    [ ] save behaviour as the files screen
                    [ ] configuration activity to configure what files will be displayed (own/course)
                [ ] 1x1 "widget" that launches the app, but changes the icon with dark mode
                    [ ] also let the app icon change with dark mode again, so the app icon is right in the overview screen
            [ ] messages
                [ ] add support for viewing the outbox
                [ ] downloading message attachments
                [ ] add support for attachments via the "Wysiwyg Uploads" folder, also with share Intents
            [ ] bump version

            [ ] update description
            [ ] write changelog
            [ ] update on play store
        1.1.0:
            [ ] support for multiple accounts
                [ ] document provider: filenames have to include the server name and user id to be unique
                [ ] DB and API-prefs also have to include the server name and user id as the name
                [ ] when logging out, only the current account data should be deleted
                [ ] you should be able to switch accounts in the settings menu
                    [ ] changing accounts has to restart the app, in case there are multiple tasks open, which would use the old db and api
            [ ] OAuth
                [ ] add the option for the user to provide a OAuth consumer key and consumer secret, so private installations can enable OAuth
                    for app users without having to integrate the OAuth data into the sourcecode.
            [ ] blubber
                [ ] support for personal chats via blubber
                [ ] option to check for blubber messages more frequently than normal notifications, and to only enable this when connected to wifi

                    [ ] separate frequency for mobile data
                [ ] support for course blubbers

                [ ] whatsapp-like list for chats, try to emulate a messenger app with blubber
                [ ] intent filter to send a blubber to someone
                [ ] idea: encrypted blubber: use end-to-end-encryption with a pre-shared secret, Base64-encode the cypthertext and urlencode it
                    [ ] decryption will only work in the app

                        Use Diffie-Hellman to generate a shared key

            [ ] update on play store
        1.2.0:
            [ ] add support for JSONAPI (probably requires abstracting away the api routes a bit more)
                https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35502079/custom-converter-for-retrofit-2
                [ ] JSONAPI is enabled on demo.studip.de, use that to test the implementation
                [ ] JSONAPI has a route to get all files/folders for a course, use that for the search function
                [ ] database and everything should still use the data classes, let the JSONAPI format be translated to that
                [ ] JSONAPI to POJO library?
                [ ] use JSONAPI if possible
                [ ] for features only available for JSONAPI, fail gracefully and inform the user, or hide the feature to begin with, or emulate the feature
            [ ] bump version

            [ ] update description

        1.3.0:
            [ ] option to input the file size limit of the Stud.IP system, to let the documents provider automatically break up and recombine
                files above the limit, to support arbitrarily large files

TODO: intent filter for sending a message to someone


    
    For the notification service:
    Notifications work over this api with the session cookie: /dispatch.php/jsupdater/get
    caution: just returns an empty list if the session isn't valid
    test whether it works with basic auth: no, only works with a session cookie.
    When using basic auth: add a method to API to refresh the session cookie.
    
    For the mails: presumably all javascript-used routes only work with a session cookie.
    Use the same technique for the route to get users

Add the ability to transfer app data to another phone via bluetooth.
A one-time-password is generated and the user has to enter it on the app of the other phone.
A key is derived from this password and all data encrypted with it.

IMPORTANT: If LiveData changes while an activity is in the stopped state and then returns to resumed, does it get the update?
https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata
Always up to date data
    If a lifecycle becomes inactive, it receives the latest data upon becoming active again.
