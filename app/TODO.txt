        [ ] opt-out of stretching for overscroll?

    Roadmap:
        1.1.0:
            [ ] fix Courseware for Stud.IP 5.0
            [ ] add the option to search for new news and forum entries when refreshing courses and color the icon red, to get the same feature as
                the web version
                [ ] add the option for the notification service to do this and emit extra notifications, even if the notification setting is turned off
            [ ] deep links improvements
                [ ] support for more link types
                    [ ] planner
            [ ] support for the planner
            [ ] app widgets
                [ ] planner
                    [ ] updates automatically when the planner is updated in the app
            [ ] add in-memory caching for up to 10 seconds for results from the document provider
            [ ] support for multiple accounts
                [ ] document provider: filenames have to include the server name and user id to be unique
                [ ] DB and API-prefs also have to include the server name and user id as the name
                [ ] when logging out, only the current account data should be deleted
                [ ] you should be able to switch accounts in the settings menu
                    [ ] changing accounts has to restart the app, in case there are multiple tasks open, which would use the old db and api
            [ ] OAuth
                [ ] add the option for the user to provide a OAuth consumer key and consumer secret, so private installations can enable OAuth
                    for app users without having to integrate the OAuth data into the sourcecode.
            [ ] blubber
                [ ] support for personal chats via blubber
                [ ] option to check for blubber messages more frequently than normal notifications, and to only enable this when connected to wifi
                    [ ] frequency up to 30 seconds
                    [ ] separate frequency for mobile data
                [ ] support for course blubbers
                [ ] if you invite people to a personal blubber, does it become a group chat? Yes
                [ ] whatsapp-like list for chats, try to emulate a messenger app with blubber
                [ ] intent filter to send a blubber to someone
                [ ] idea: encrypted blubber: use end-to-end-encryption with a pre-shared secret, Base64-encode the cypthertext and urlencode it
                    [ ] decryption will only work in the app
                    [ ] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21081713/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-in-java
                        Use Diffie-Hellman to generate a shared key
            [ ] bump version
            [ ] update help text
            [ ] update description
            [ ] write changelog
            [ ] update on play store
        1.2.0:
            [ ] add support for JSONAPI (probably requires abstracting away the api routes a bit more)
                https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35502079/custom-converter-for-retrofit-2
                [ ] JSONAPI is enabled on demo.studip.de, use that to test the implementation
                [ ] JSONAPI has a route to get all files/folders for a course, use that for the search function
                [ ] database and everything should still use the data classes, let the JSONAPI format be translated to that
                [ ] JSONAPI to POJO library?
                [ ] use JSONAPI if possible
                [ ] for features only available for JSONAPI, fail gracefully and inform the user, or hide the feature to begin with, or emulate the feature
            [ ] bump version
            [ ] update help text
            [ ] update description
            [ ] write changelog
            [ ] update on play store
        1.3.0:
            [ ] option to input the file size limit of the Stud.IP system, to let the documents provider automatically break up and recombine
                files above the limit, to support arbitrarily large files
            [ ] plugins:
                [ ] vips

TODO: intent filter for sending a message to someone


    
    For the notification service:
    Notifications work over this api with the session cookie: /dispatch.php/jsupdater/get
    caution: just returns an empty list if the session isn't valid
    test whether it works with basic auth: no, only works with a session cookie.
    When using basic auth: add a method to API to refresh the session cookie.
    
    For the mails: presumably all javascript-used routes only work with a session cookie.
    Use the same technique for the route to get users

    messages: avoid reloading ALL messages, load one at a time and stop when the first cached message is encountered
    
    after logging in, check for available API-routes and tell the user if features aren't available because the provider disabled the API route
    add a settings button to re-perform the check, so the user doesn't have to log out if an API-route is enabled

Add the ability to transfer app data to another phone via bluetooth.
A one-time-password is generated and the user has to enter it on the app of the other phone.
A key is derived from this password and all data encrypted with it.

IMPORTANT: If LiveData changes while an activity is in the stopped state and then returns to resumed, does it get the update?
https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata
Always up to date data
    If a lifecycle becomes inactive, it receives the latest data upon becoming active again.

    general:
        To make a new icon from a svg, convert it to a png with GIMP and then use it in android studio
    
    plugins:
        plugins don't seem to have a REST api defined, probably because there wasn't an app for so long
        
        make issues on github for the plugins to define REST-APIs:
